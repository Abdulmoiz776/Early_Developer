Drug Prescription EDA
Overview
This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a drug prescription dataset. It aims to uncover relationships between variables like age, Na_to_K ratios, and drug preferences to identify patterns and trends.

Key Features
Analysis of numerical and categorical features.
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Outlier detection and distribution visualization.
Key insights into age-based and Na_to_K-specific drug preferences.
Libraries Used
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly Express
Visualizations
Count plots of categorical features like sex, BP, cholesterol, and drug types.
Histograms and scatter plots for numerical features.
Insights into age and Na_to_K ratio distribution for drug types.
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries (pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly).
Run the code in your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
Insights and Summary
DrugY is prescribed across all age groups and higher Na_to_K levels.
DrugB targets older individuals with lower Na_to_K levels.
Drugs A, C, and X are prescribed for specific Na_to_K ranges and age groups.
Future Work
Apply statistical tests (e.g., chi-square) to validate categorical relationships.
Extend the analysis with predictive modeling.
